## Objective:
HomeSwap is a full-stack web application designed to revolutionize the home exchange experience. Inspired by the success of platforms like Airbnb, HomeSwap aims to provide a seamless and secure platform for users to list their properties, discover unique homes around the world, and arrange home swaps with other members. By promoting sustainable travel and cultural exchange, HomeSwap encourages users to immerse themselves in new destinations while minimizing their environmental impact. HomeSwap offers an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in building a complex, real-world application using modern web technologies. Through this project, students will learn to tackle challenges such as user authentication, property listing management, search and filtering, messaging, calendar integration, and more.
