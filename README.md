## Objective
HomeSwap is a full-stack web application designed to provide a platform for users to list, discover, and book properties. Inspired by platforms like Airbnb, this project aims to create a functional property rental system within a 3-week timeframe. The application will focus on core features such as user authentication, property management, booking system, reviews, and secure payments. Through this project, developers will gain hands-on experience in building a real-world application using modern web technologies, addressing challenges in user authentication, database management, search functionality, and payment integration.
